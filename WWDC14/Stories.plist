			<string>In August 2012, I organized the the &quot;Computer Science Lecture&quot; at the University for Kids, a yearly event hosted by my university. I enjoyed it a lot, since love doing both - working with children as well as talking about computer science :-) </string>

			<string>After my high school graduation in 2008, I first did a voluntary, three-month internship in the asset management department of a big real estate company in Oberhausen, Northrhine-Westfalia. I learned a lot, especially that I didn&apos;t want to study business ;-)</string>
			<string>In November 2008, I started my civil service, which I did in a bilingual kindergarden (German and English). The civil service at that time was mandatory for those high school graduate who rejected going to the military for 9 month (this was also the duration of the civil server).</string>
			<string>I love working (or rather playing :-) with children! At that time, I even became the babysitter in multiple families who had at least one of their children in that kindergarden.</string>

			<string>In the eleventh grade, I decided to go abroad for one year. At that time, I had learned French in school for three years and liked it a lot, this was one of the main reasons why I picked France as the target country.</string>
			<string> The year was organized by a school exchange organisation called AFS. I lived in a very nice host family and went to a regular French high scool. My host brother once took me to his fencing practice - I immediately got addicted to it and trained 4 times a week for the rest of the year.</string>
			<string>All in all I met a lot of nice people and had a very exciting and fun year! Looking back this was one of the greatest times of my life so far!</string>

			<string>One year after my high school graduation, after having finished my civil service, I enrolled in a  Bachelor program in Business Information Technology at the University of Mannheim. Studying in Mannheim is just great, the university&apos;s main building is an actual castle.</string>
			<string>Until then I was always fascinated by computers, but hadn&apos;t written a single line of code. But once I started, I got addicted to it. My favorite class in the three years of the Bachelor was Software Engineering, which we had in the fourth semester. In this class, next to a theoretical lecture, students had to work on a group project and build a bank depot management system.</string>
			<string>The software had to be written in Java (the GUI was developed with the Swing framework) and was connected to an XML interface that was provided by our instructors to deliver the recent stock prices.</string>

			<string>After having finished my Bachelor studies, I continued right away with the Master program which I will finish in January 2015. I am enjoying my studies a lot, Master students have to chose one of three so-called specialization tracks, mine is called &quot;System Design &amp; Development&quot; and focusses on the whole software engineering process and everything that is related to it.</string>
			<string>In my first two semester I was working on a team project, which students are required to do at my university. With a team of a total of five students, we developed a distribtuted &quot;Patient scheduling simulation tool based on Agent technology. The tool was developed in Java and built on top of the Agent framework JADE and can be used to analyze and compare different patient scheduling algorithms.</string>
			<string>I still love being in Mannheim, I made a lot of friends there and I am living in an apartment that I share with three other guys, two of which I met during my very first day at the univeristy in August 2008.</string>

            <string>Right after my Bachelor graduation I switch from the department "Master Data Governance" where I wrote my Bachelor thesis to the department "IT Mobile - Center of Excellence (CoE)", my team was concerned with building SAP internal apps that were to be used by employees.</string>
            <string>From June until August I developed my first real iOS app, it was was "MyStaffingList" and was intented to be used mostly by SAP consultants to help them getting an overview of their current staffings and projects. The app ran against an SAP backend with a REST interface.</string>
            <string>In the following year I was implementing one prototype for an app idea in our team, was responsible for maintenance of the "MyStaffingList" app and was helping out in a couple of bigger projects within my team.</string>

            <string>During my semester abroad in Seoul, I met another German guy. He studied Business in Münster, but originally he came from Hamburg, just like me. At that time, he was working for a start-up with a few friends from him from Hamburg. They were developing an iPhone app that combined instant messaging with a "friends finding" function, called LetsMapp.</string>
            <string>I joined the team whithout practical experience on iOS at a point in time when the iPhone app was basically already done. The app worked very well, users could log in with Facebook and then see all their friends that were also using the app on a map. The major drawback of the app was its battery consumption as we were doing regular GPS updates so that movements of friends would be visible.</string>
            <string>We put a lot of effort into optimizing the algorithm for updating locations to save battery power. After we returned to Germany, I helped building the website, but after returning to Mannheim I had to focus on finishing my Bachelor and writing my thesis so I stopped my activities for LetsMapp.</string>

            <string>In the third semester of my Master, I decided once more to go abroad. After having been to Seoul during my Bachelor studies, this time I chose a closer destination, Amsterdam! Iloved the city from the first day, life quality there is very high! I didn't want to live in the student dorms this time, so I tackled apartment search in Amsterdam.</string>
            <string>Little did I know that this is a challenging task in Amsterdam, especially with a student budget. Luckily I had my job at Cameramanager to be able to afford rooms. During my whole stay, I couldn't find a permanent place, so over the whole period that I have been staying in Amsterdam I lived in 4 diffrrent appartments with different roommates.</string>
            <string>I studied at the Vrije Universiteit, my classes were very interesting and I learned a lot! One class was called "Internet Programming", in this class we had regular programming assignments that we usually had to write in C and where we were exploring the C networking API.</string>

            <string>For the time of my studies in Amsterdam, I applied for a job as iOS developer at a few companies. After a Skype interview and one visit at their office in Amsterdam, I signed a working contract as freelance iOS developer. In August when my classes hadn't yet started, I worked full-time, after that I reduce my work time a bit depending on the workload I had for my classes at the VU.</string>
            <string>Cameramanager offers camera surveillance with IP cameras that can be managed in the cloud. Just before I started working there in August, the copmany had been acquired by Panasonic. At the time I started working there, the company already had an iOS app in the App Store, but had just decided to build a completely new interface for it.</string>
            <string>I was (and still am) the only iOS developer in the company, I looked at the code from the old app, was shocked and decided to start the new app from scratch. I tried to reuse as much code as possible from the old app, which finally came down to a few helper classes that I could integrate with the new UI. I managed to build and publish the first version of the (universal) app within 2.5 month and added many features since then.</string>
